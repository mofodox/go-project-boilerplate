# go-template-project

This is a starter template project for Go. With this I can start a project with git initialised so I don't have to create a new repo and the boilerplate is ready for me to start tinkering with it.

## How to get started?

You can clone this project by:

```
git clone git@github.com:mofodox/go-template-project.git <name_of_your_project>
```

and you're can start coding.

# go-project-boilerplate

This is a starter template project to start REST API in Go. With this I can start a project with git initialised so I don't have to create a new repo and the boilerplate is ready for me to start tinkering with it.

## How to get started?

You can clone this project by:

```
git clone git@github.com:mofodox/go-template-project.git <name_of_your_project>
```

and you're can start coding.

Don't forget to change the git remote origin URL which it can be done as so:

- Create a new repo (add README.md will work too)
- On your local, open terminal and type in this ```git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git``` (change USERNAME to your github username and REPOSITORY to your newly created repo)
- Once that done, you can run ```git push```
